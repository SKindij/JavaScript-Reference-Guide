# Web API
&emsp;Global Window object is an object that provides access to the browser's Web API.

&emsp;In fact, if the programs are written in different languages, it can be difficult to make them friends and make them communicate with each other. That's why **APIs** (_Application Programming Interface_) exist.<br>
&emsp;JavaScript objects are very useful for transferring data from one site to another, especially when using APIs.

&emsp;**API** - structured form of communication between different applications.<br>
**REST** (_Representational State Transfer_) - component communication style in which all required data is specified in request parameters.<br>
&emsp; The interaction between the client and the server is reduced to 4 operations
   |   C    |   R   |     U      |   D    |
   |--------|-------|------------|--------|
   | create | read  |   update   | delete |
   |  POST  |  GET  | PUT, PATCH | DELETE |

&emsp; **RPC** (_Remote Procedure Call_) - is a style in which request message stores action to be performed and data required for that action.<br>
&emsp; **JSON-RPC** must have the following fields:
  |      method      |       params    |          id          |
  |------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
  | "name of method" | [array of data] | establish compliance |
