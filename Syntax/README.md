# Syntax

## <a name="variables"></a>Variables:

&ensp;In JavaScript, you can **declare a variable** using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword.\
**Assignment** is the process of giving a value to a declared variable.
> ```javascript
>  // When you declare variable without initializing it, the variable is automatically assigned value undefined.
>    var someVariable; let anotherVariable;
>  // const variables must always be initialized with value, and their value cannot be changed afterward.
>    const PI = 3.14159; const specificNumber = 10;
>  // most basic assignment operator is equals sign (=)
>    someVariable = 'any word';
>  // There are also compound operators, which perform operation and assign result to variable in single step.  
>    let sn = 20;
>      sn += 13; // => 33 - equivalent to sn = sn + 13; 
>      sn -= 9; // => 24 - equivalent to sn = sn - 9; 
>      sn *= 2; // => 48 equivalent to sn = sn * 2;
>      sn /= 6; // => 8 - equivalent to sn = sn / 6;
>      sn %= 5; // => 3 - equivalent to sn = sn % 5;
> ```

&ensp;Variables that hold **non-primitive data types** (such as objects and arrays) are assigned by reference, while variables that hold **primitive data types** (such as numbers, strings, and booleans) are assigned by value.  
> _When a variable is assigned by reference, it stores a reference to the memory location where the value is stored, rather than the value itself. This can have implications when modifying the value of the variable._

&ensp;In JS, you can declare a variable with the same name multiple times within the same scope using the `var` keyword. However, this is generally considered a **bad practice** and can lead to unexpected behavior. The later declaration will simply override the previous declaration, which can cause confusion and bugs.

&ensp;In contrast, when using `let` or `const` to declare variables, you cannot redeclare a variable with the same name within the same block of code.

&ensp;**Shadowing** occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. 
The inner variable will "shadow" the outer variable, making it inaccessible within that scope.
> ```javascript
>  let someDigit = 25;
>  function foo() {
>    let someDigit = 30; // inner variable shadows outer variable
>    console.log(someDigit); // => 30
>  }
>  foo();
>  console.log(someDigit); // => 25 - outer variable is still accessible outside of function
> ```

&ensp;**Temporal Dead Zone** (TDZ) - behavior in JS that prevents variables from being accessed before they are declared.\
If you try to access a `let` or `const` variable before its declaration, you will get a `ReferenceError: is not defined`.

&ensp;When naming variables, you should follow certain conventions:
- variable names are case-sensitive; 
- can contain letters, numbers, and underscores;
- must start with a letter or an underscore;
- use camelCase or snake_case for variable names;
- choose descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable; 
- important to avoid using reserved keywords.


## <a name="data-types"></a>Data types:

### Number()

> * &ensp; ``Number.isFinite (constNum);`` <br>
> > ```javascript
> >    Number.isFinite (17); // => true       if a number was passed to it during the call
> >    Number.isFinite ('17'); // => false       if a special value or non-numeric type is passed
> > ```
> * &ensp; ``constNum.toString(2);`` - _converts a number to a string in the specified number system_ <br>
> > ```javascript
> >    let constNum = 29;
> >    constNum.toString(2); // => '11101'
> > ```
> * &ensp; ``constNum.toFixed(2)`` - _converts a number to a string with the specified number of decimal places_  <br>
> > ```javascript
> >    let constNum = 16.5492;
> >    constNum.toFixed(2) // => '16.55'
> > ```
> * &ensp; they convert the string character by character as long as possible
> > ```javascript
> >    Number.parseInt('123boxes', 10); // => 123
> >    Number.parseFloat('27.16% market share'); // =>  27.16
> > ```
> * &ensp; ``Math.round(num);`` - _normal rounding_
> * &ensp; ``Math.ceil(num);`` - _rounding to the top_
> * &ensp; ``Math.floor(num); `` - _rounding to the smaller side_
> * &ensp; ``Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;`` - _generate a random number in a range_
> * &ensp; ``Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length);`` -  _generate a random array element_
> * &ensp; ``Math.max(num1, num2, ...);`` - _returns the largest integer in the set_
> * &ensp; ``Math.min(num1, num2, ...);`` - _returns the smallest number in the set_

### String()

&ensp;A tag template is a loggerTag function that allows you to parse a template string.
> > ```javascript
> >    let phrase = 'It will be a victorious UA spring!';
> >      phrase.toUpperCase(); // => 'IT WILL BE A VICTORIOUS UA SPRING!'
> >      phrase.toLowerCase(); // => 'it will be a victorious ua spring!'
> >      phrase.length; // => 34
> >        phrase.includes("UA"); // => true
> >        phrase.startsWith('It will be'); // => true
> >        phrase.endsWith('UA spring!'); // => true
> >        phrase.indexOf('victorious'); // => 13
> >        phrase.substring(3, 10); // => 'will be'
> >
> >    const arrPhrase = phrase.split(' '); // => ['It', 'will', 'be', 'a', 'victorious', 'UA', 'spring!']
> >    arrPhrase.join(' '); // => 'It will be a victorious UA spring!'
> > ```

&ensp;Let's consider a few more manipulations with the text.
> > ```javascript
> >    let stringo = 'A great man does great things on great days.';
> >      stringo.replaceAll('great', 'small'); // => 'A small man does small things on small days.'
> >      stringo.charAt(8); // => 'm'
> >      stringo.slice(8, 23); // => 'man does great '
> > ```


### Null and Undefined: 
In JavaScript, null and undefined are special values that represent the absence of a value. When you assign null to a variable, you are explicitly setting it to have no value. When a variable is declared but not assigned any value, it is automatically assigned the value undefined.


&ensp;``Symbol`` is a unique identifier that is used as the name of properties in objects;
> * &ensp; ``Symbol.iterator`` - allows in constructions using ``for..of`` and spread syntax ``...``;
> * &ensp; ``Symbol.for(key)`` â€” returns the symbol stored by the key;

> When creating a symbol, you can give a description (the so-called name), which is mainly used to debug the code:
> > ```javascript 
> > let id = Symbol("idento"); 
> > alert(id.description); // => id
> > ```
> They create "hidden" properties of objects that cannot be accidentally accessed and overwritten from other parts of the program.
> > ```javascript 
> > let usero = { name: "potatoGrower", [id]: 123, town: "Lynovo" }; 
> > // Properties whose keys are symbols are not iterated over by the for..in loop.
> > let clone = Object.assign({}, usero); // clones all types of object properties;
> > ```


## <a name="variable-scope"></a>Variable scope:
&ensp;It refers to the **accessibility and visibility of a variable** within a certain portion of code during runtime.\
It determines where a variable can be accessed and modified within a program. 
* global scope
* local scope 
* function scope
* block scope

 
* `var` has function-level scope, meaning they are accessible 
  - within the function they are declared in 
  - or globally if declared outside any function;
* `let` and `const` have block-level scope, meaning they are accessible 
  - only within the block of code they are declared in, such as a loop or an if statement.


## <a name="additionally"></a>Additionally:

### hoisting





### Lexical scope (also known as static scope):
&ensp;It is a concept that determines how **variable names** are resolved at runtime based on their position in the source code during the static phase of code compilation. It is determined by the nesting of functions within other functions or code blocks in the source code, and it remains fixed during the entire runtime of the program.

&ensp;**Lexical scope** plays a role in determining the **variable scope**. Variables declared in a certain scope (_function or a code block_) have access to the surrounding lexical scope, which allows them to access variables from their parent scopes.\
> In other words, **lexical scope** is determined by the nesting of functions within other functions or code blocks **in the source code**. When a variable is referenced within a function, JS looks for that variable first within the local scope of the function, and if not found, it looks in the next outer scope until it reaches the global scope.
> > ```javascript
> >  const globalVar = 'I am global!';
> >  function outerFunction() {
> >     const outerVar = 'I am outer!';  
> >     function innerFunction() {
> >        const innerVar = 'I am inner!';
> >        console.log(globalVar); // accesses from global scope
> >        console.log(outerVar); // accesses from outer scope
> >        console.log(innerVar); // accesses from local scope
> >     }
> >    innerFunction();
> >  }
> >  
> >  outerFunction();
> > ```
