# Control flow
&ensp; It is a fundamental aspect of programming that allows you to control the order in which statements are executed in your code.

## <a name="conditionals"></a>ðŸ“– Conditionals:
&ensp; They are used to execute different code blocks depending on whether a condition is true or false. 

> **if/else statement:**
> > ```javascript
> >  if (condition) {
> >    // code to be executed if condition is true
> >  } else {
> >    // code to be executed if condition is false
> >  }
> > ```

> **switch statement:**
> > ```javascript
> >  switch (expression) {
> >    case value1:
> >      // code to be executed if expression matches value1
> >      break;
> >    case value2:
> >      // code to be executed if expression matches value2
> >      break;
> >    default:
> >      // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
> >  }
> > ```

> **ternary operator:**
> **switch statement:**
> > ```javascript
> >  // If condition is true, expression1 is evaluated, otherwise expression2 is evaluated.
> >  condition ? expression1 : expression2;
> > ```


## <a name="loops"></aðŸ“– Loops:
&ensp; They are used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

> **for loop:**
> > ```javascript
> >  for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
> >    // code to be executed
> >  }
> > ```

> **while loop:**
> > ```javascript
> >  while (condition) {
> >    // code to be executed
> >  }
> > ```

> **do..while loop:**
> > ```javascript
> >  do {
> >    // code to be executed
> >  } while (condition);
> > ```
