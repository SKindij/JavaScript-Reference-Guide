# A function is a block of various commands that serves to organize and structure the program code.

* function declaration
  + named: ``function namedFunc(arguments) { do something }``
  + anonymous: ``function(arguments) { do something }``
* function expression
  + ``const namedFunc = function(argument) { code to be executed }``

Technically, a function is a JavaScript object that has an internal ``Call()`` method that adds the ability to call the function.
The ``return`` statement is used to pass a value from the function body to external code.
